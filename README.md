# ClearText: Redefining Readability

## Description

There are currently two main ways that readability comes up in the present. The firt is readability tools, such as Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog, and ARI, that formulate what reading level a text should be based primarily on average words in a sentence and average syllables in a word. Alternatively, there are tools on the internet, such as Grammarly, Hemingway Editor, and popular LLMs, that help a user write better and in a more readable manner, through the use of AI. The drawback with these tools is that they do not have one explicit calculation that is used to come up with their content. 

We are trying to bridge the gap between these two groups, by creating a readability tool that has more nuance for other factors that matter outside of average words in a sentence and average syllables in a word, while still utilizing an explicit calculation which text can be graded against.
